My wife and I have been trying to reduce the amount of carbs we are consuming on a regular basis.  So I bought a bunch of sweet potatoes and made a big thing of mashed sweet potatoes, which we ate along with our baked chicken and veggies.

One week I bought too many, and I began to think of what else I could do with them.  I must've had sweet potato french fries the day before and that got me wondering.

 > If you can do it with a potato, can you do it with a sweet potato?

The next morning I had the idea of making sauted sweet potatoes, but then I took it a step further.  I have a food processor which I don't use enough, could I use it to make hash browns?

During the process of peeling and shredding the sweet potatoes, I started thinking about what I could do outside of scrambling the eggs.  I always scramble the eggs.

 > Since I'm trying something new with the sweet potato, might as well try something new with the egg.

So once confirming with my wife that she was not vhemitely against the idea, I went for it.  My first time frying an egg.  It's not the prettiest.  I may have burned it a little, but it was one great meat.  Who knew sweet potatoes could be so sweet?
