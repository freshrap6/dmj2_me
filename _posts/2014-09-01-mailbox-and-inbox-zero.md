This weekend I rediscovered [Mailbox](http://www.mailboxapp.com) and [inbox zero](http://www.43folders.com/izero).  I tried using Mailbox a few years ago, but I didn't get it.  I heard it was supposed to change the way I used email, but I didn't get it.  Last week I got my betacoin and I wanted try Mailbox out.  I don't use a desktop mail client, so I was interested in trying one out.

I tried using it for 2 days with little success.  Then I downloaded the app to my phone and that's where the real break through happened.  My wife was looking at my phone and commented on the 13000 badge that sat atop the Mailbox icon on my phone.  "Why do you have so many emails in your inbox", she questioned.  "I don't I replied, that's probably a bug.  I use filters and mark as read the emails in my inbox."  She took a closer look.  "You don't archive anything, so everything is right there.  Plus priority inbox only moves important mail up, your inbox still contains all of that crap."  That's when it hit me, I've been doing it wrong.

To me priority inbox was great.  I had become slightly dependent on it.  It took everything I was going with my filters one step further.  I would focus only on the emails in the important section and ignore the others.  I'm also a very visual person, so seeing the emails at the top half of the screen marked as read gave me some sense of completion and satisfaction.  As the non-important emails faded into the background I stopped paying attention to them.  I thought they were distappearing and going away.  Sadly Mailbox taught me that this was not the case.

Armed with this new information I begain to work my way towards inbox zero from 13000.  I spent about 2 hours last night deleting and archiving emails.  I know I could just archive them all and start with a clean slate, but I know I've built up so much crap I want to go through and delete it all myself.

This whole process has got me thinking about '[mise in place](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_place)'.  It's a french term for "everything in it's place".  The idea is to strip away the clutter and distractions to prevent disaster.  The more clean and neat your workspace is the less mental clutter you will have.  Sadly this is not the case with my email, and much of my life.  So Mailbox has helped me rethink my life essentially.
