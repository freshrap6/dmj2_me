When I was young I hated cleaning.

In college I had a friend who inspired me to be a little more organized.  So I'd clean up every now and then.  Mostly when my girlfriend was visiting, or near the begining of a semester.

When I graduated I spent some time living with a relative, and didn't have much to clean since I only had one room.


As I got older and got my own place, I started to pay a little more attention to my living conditions.  Cleaning was still tough, but I knew it had to be done.  For some reason I started doing my best cleaning then when I was upset.

Flash forward a few years to the present, and cleaning has taken an all new meaning with me.  It's become a form of meditation.  I still tend to clean when I get bothered, but I tend to get really focused and relaxed.  My mind tends to focus on the task at hand, and eventually I forget what upset me.  I go into this zone.  30 minutes to an hour later I have a cleaner house and a more peaceful temperment.

Who knew cleaning could be a form of meditation?
